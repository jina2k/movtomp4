Bulk converting MOV files to MP4 using ffmpeg

Made for personal use, for ease of viewing on Windows 10's proprietary app "Movies & TV". (Instead of using VLC media player)

For non-technical people:

1. Download ffmpeg https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows
2. Copy the bash script file (convert.sh) into the directory with MOV files.
3. Open Windows Powershell, navigate to the directory with MOV files, then run the command `bash ./convert.sh`
